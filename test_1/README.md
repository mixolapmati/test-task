Task: write tests for class [AliasDict](https://github.com/LanselotOz/test-task/blob/master/test_1/aliasdict.py). 

Goal: 100% coverage and all edge cases. 

Free to choose test framework.

How to use tests.py:

tests.py have to be runned from the same catalog where is aliasdict.py file.

Command:
```
$ ./tests.py
```

Test has doctest and five custom testcases, but i'm not sure regarding "100% coverage".
